# Welcome to the Oshawa NDP üçä

For more than sixty years, Oshawa‚Äôs New Democrats have stood proudly at the heart of Canada‚Äôs progressive movement. We are activists, workers, artists - neighbours brought together by a deep belief in a better world founded on labour solidarity, strong public services, and environmental justice. For generations, we have joined together to fight for a fair and equitable future.

Our city was home to former NDP Leader Ed Broadbent, a tireless champion for human rights whose legacy continues to inspire us today. After some challenging elections, the Oshawa New Democrats have been proud to carry forward that tradition with four consecutive winning campaigns for MPP Jennifer French, whose leadership continues to reflect the community‚Äôs values of strength, compassion, and fairness.

But the Oshawa New Democrats are more than a campaign team‚Äîwe are a community. Together we work hard, support one another, and find common purpose in our progressive values at a time when the world can feel uncertain. We welcome everyone, and we make sure diverse voices are not only heard but valued. As part of Canada‚Äôs only truly democratic political party, every member has a vote to help shape our future, from electing leaders to debating policies at provincial and federal conventions.

Here in Oshawa, we carry forward a proud history of progressive leadership while building a more just and equitable tomorrow. We hope you‚Äôll join us.
