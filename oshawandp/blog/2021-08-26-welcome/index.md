This is the pinned homepage of all our featured RSS feeds and blog posts (or, self-published articles). We would ideally put a call to action and broad statement that doesn't fade out of relevance very often here. Imagine whose profiles we may want to feature here (IF ANY). I can remove that if it invites chaos. Anyways, this is what the homepage of the News section is all about.

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:

![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)

The blog supports tags as well!

**And if you don't want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config.
