# üçä Why be a member

Now is a great time to become a member of the NDP!  Your voice in Oshawa matters, and by joining the NDP you will also be joining like-minded, progressive community members, your neighbours, in helping build a stronger Oshawa, a stronger Ontario, and a stronger Canada. 

Life is challenging, and connecting with others has never been more important. The NDP continues to put people first with every decision: fighting for fair wages, better benefits, safer working conditions, stronger schools, housing you can afford, and building and protecting public healthcare for all. 

The NDP believe a more fair, just, and equitable Canada is possible. Through your membership with the NDP, you will help grow the local team in Oshawa, and help guide the direction and policies of the party.

‚ÄúWith courage and compassion, we can lift each other up, and keep each other up there.‚Äù
